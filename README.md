# DAT490-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
This is a group project which I contributed with my peer at ASU. We conduct the data science capstone on 'Feed Grain Consumption Trends in Worldwide' for 7.5 weeks. 
ðŸ”‘ Key Keywords Found
- Grain price volatility depends on geography, year and product type

- Climate change affects agricultural production and developing economies

- Trends in animal feed demand increase, but production may decrease in the future

- Impacts from global economic and policy factors such as import and export tariffs

ðŸ›  Tools used in the study
- Data source from USDA to check for anomalies and classify data

- Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis to examine factors affecting prices and production volumes

- Using Tableau and Python in Jupyter Notebook to analyze animal feed trends

- Using Logistic Regression and LSTM Neural Network to predict product demand

- Random Forest Algorithm to identify factors influencing grain prices

ðŸš§ Problems encountered and solutions
- Price data are diverse and asymmetric, cleaning and normalization are required

- Non-normality of year data, Logarithmic Transformation is used to make it more uniformly distributed

- Limitations of the prediction model, Fine-tuning Hyperparameters is used to increase accuracy

- Some models do not predict trends well. Use Ridge Regression and Polynomial Components.

ðŸ”® Future applications
- This model can be used to forecast trends in crops in each region.

- Help the government plan agriculture and import crops more accurately.

- Develop the integration of weather data and satellite images to increase the accuracy of the analysis.

- Promote the use of alternative animal feeds such as insect and algae proteins.

- Improve the model to reduce the impact of climate change on agricultural product prices.

In conclusion, this research can be developed to reduce the impact on farmers and the animal feed industry, and provide policymakers with useful information for decision-making.
