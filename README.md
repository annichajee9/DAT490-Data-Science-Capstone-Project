- Importance of Feed Grain Pricing
Feed grains which is including barley, corn, oats, and sorghum—are fundamental to agriculture worldwide. Their pricing influences farm profits, food security, and supply chain stability. As global markets fluctuate, understanding these trends becomes increasingly vital for farmers, policymakers, and researchers alike.

- Motivation & Background
There're three key aspects drive our analysis: agricultural sustainability, market volatility, and supply chain disruptions. These factors directly impact economies, food production, and trade policies, making them crucial areas of study.

- Methodologies Used
To conduct this analysis, we relied on data from the USDA and the Maddison Database. Our process involved several steps:
1. Data Collection & Cleaning — This included handling missing values, standardizing units, and ensuring statistical accuracy.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis — We used correlation matrices and variance calculations to identify trends.
3. Feature Engineering — Historical intervals were categorized to improve predictions.

Next, we implemented machine learning models, including Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM Neural Networks. These models help forecast pricing trends by analyzing past data.

- Machine Learning & Optimization
To refine our model accuracy, hyperparameter tuning techniques were applied—such as Random Search via Keras Tuner and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Adam Optimizer helped improve performance, ensuring our predictions remained robust.

- Consumption & Price Trends
Mapping feed grain consumption trends by region allows us to see the varied demand patterns. Additionally, individual commodity pricing trends—such as corn versus sorghum—show fluctuations influenced by external economic conditions, trade policies, and climate factors.

- Conclusion & Final Takeaways
  - Proper preprocessing significantly enhances forecasting accuracy.
  - Macroeconomic factors—such as inflation and trade regulations—still dominate price movement.
  - Advanced predictive models like LSTM are valuable but require continuous optimization.
